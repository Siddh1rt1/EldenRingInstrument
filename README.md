# EldenRingInstrument
Playing EldenRing with a instrument, using frequency analysis or something chatgpt told me.

So i am not a good programmer, half of this is generated so don't blame me. :D

in theory you just need replace the frequencys with the instrument of your choice.

Don't download the code, if you are not trusting it. i am not taking any responsibilites, how this works and what it does.
thank you kindly.
want to say hello? @bambitango
